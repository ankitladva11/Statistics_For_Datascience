# Statistics for Data Science: Method and Implementation
This repository contains code and documentation for a data science project that involves the use of statistical methods to analyze and understand patterns in data. The aim of the project is to XYZ.

### Data
The data used in this project consists of XYZ variables measured for N individuals. The data is stored in a CSV file, which is included in the data directory of this repository.

### Statistical Methods
The following statistical methods are used in this project:

 - Descriptive statistics: to summarize and describe the characteristics of the data
 - Inferential statistics: to make predictions or inferences about a larger population based on a sample   of the data
 - Regression analysis: to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent   variables
 - Hypothesis testing: to determine whether a difference or relationship between variables is   statistically significant
### Implementation
The code for the statistical analyses is implemented in Python, using the NumPy, Pandas, and   Scikit-learn libraries. The code is organized into several Jupyter notebooks, which are located in the   notebooks directory. Each notebook corresponds to a specific statistical method or analysis.

### Dependencies
To run the code in this repository, you will need to install the following dependencies:

Python 3
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
